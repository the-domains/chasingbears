There have been few options for people who want an open source router. The determined DIY customer could purchase a router and flash their own open source firmware. But now that the FCC requires router manufacturers to lock down the 5ghz module things have gone from bad to worse. Most manufacturers have taken the easy way out by locking down their firmware. They have essentially turned their back on developers and the open source community. 

I know! But don't panic! WRTWRX is on the way.

## What is WRTWRX? 

WRTWRX creates building blocks that dramatically reduces software development. What is the first test for WRTWRX you ask? An open source router.

Stay tuned for more updates.
